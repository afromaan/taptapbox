## Overview
TapTapBox is fully 3D printed (resin) small keyboard with nine buttons, each one for one thing and the display to see time, volume and other stats you choose.

It also provides the feeling of quality product thanks to brown switches and minimal lag.

## 3D model done
Because we have the 3D model made, we are going to struggle with code (its first version is in files above). 
Our plan is to make it work with minimum settings and minimum lag, so we are also making website for TapTapBox, where you will be able to set everything to get best results for you. There will be settings like: LEDs modes, what display shows, configuration for each button and sound settings (like if it has to do some "pop" sound whe clicked etc.), all this from one website immediately into your TapTapBox.
In the future we want to make it wirelessv(2.4GHz and/or Bluetooth), aluminium body and premium buttons.
In the past we wanted to make one button "extra" universal by adding one of those tiny OLED displays so you would se whatever you wanted to but it would still work like button. In the end we came to conclusion that we will make it in a next version. Not the fisrt one.

The code for both the website and the RPI can be found in files.

### ⚠️ WEBSITE ISN´T ONLINE YET ⚠️
